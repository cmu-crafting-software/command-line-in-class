## Github student plan
We strongly encourage you signup for the GitHub student plan. You can do so using [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-education-for-students/apply-to-github-education-as-a-student). 

Importantly, the GitHub student plan includes 180 hours per months of free access to Codespaces:
> Verified students get free use of GitHub Codespaces, up to 180 core hours per month, for their personal accounts. The monthly amount of storage and core hours of usage available to students is equivalent to the amount included with GitHub Pro accounts. For more information, see About billing for GitHub Codespaces. For more information on getting started with GitHub Codespaces, see GitHub Codespaces overview. ([Source](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-education-for-students/about-github-education-for-students#github-education-features-for-students))

## Codespaces
Codespaces is a *development container* that includes a Linux virtual machine that you access using the Visual Studio Code. The development container can be configured specifically for the project you are working on, so you don't have to configure (or re-configure) your own local machine for each project that you need to work on. You can access the instance of Visual Studio Code in a web browser, or through your local installation of Visual Studio Code. To use Google codespaces from your local installation of Visual Studio Code, you need to install the [GitHub Codespaces extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces).
